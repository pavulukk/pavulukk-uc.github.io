- In Screenshot-2, I used the Bootstrap CSS framework to allow theming and responsive design on my website.To quickly construct the layout and components, I made use of Bootstrap's grid structure and UI elements like buttons, navbars, cards, etc. To style items without creating unique CSS, I made use of Bootstrap's utility classes for typography, colors, spacing, and scaling.I selected a Bootswatch free open-source theme and integrated it using a content delivery network (CDN) for pre-defined CSS and visual design.
- Source of my bootstrap framework : [boostrap](https://themewagon.com/theme-tag/resume/)

- In Screenshot-6, I added the Jquery operations:

- In Screeshot-7, I added to web `API` with the `HTML` file using the `script` tags.
- Firstly, I used a public API called `Quotes` which generated random codes for every one second or new refresh.
- Secondly, I used a public API called `ChuckNorris` jokes which generates random jokes by a man called norris.
